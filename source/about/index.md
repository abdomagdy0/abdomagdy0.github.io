### Hey This is Abdo
Thanks for being here! I’m Abdelrahman Magdy, also known as magdy3666. As a senior Computer Science student with a deep passion for offensive security, I spend my free time focused on penetration testing, uncovering vulnerabilities, and sharing my experiences through CTF write-ups and exploit analysis.
I hope you enjoy the content I currently publish, and I look forward to sharing even more exciting content in the future.

I’m always eager to learn, read, and dive deeper into the field, continuously pushing myself to improve. Along the way, I work hard to overcome impostor syndrome by giving my all to everything I do.
